# 🛠️ Recruitment Task: The "Cursed" Event Page

**Welcome to the [Insert Your Club Name] Recruitment Drive!**

We believe that the best way to learn is by doing—and sometimes, by fixing what others have broken. This task is designed to test your **debugging skills**, **logical thinking**, and **attention to detail**.

## 📖 The Scenario

Our previous developer started building a registration page for an upcoming "AI & Future Tech" workshop. They claimed it was "90% finished," but then they vanished. 

When we try to use the page, it’s a disaster:
1.  There are errors in the browser console.
2.  Buttons don't seem to work.
3.  The "Spots Remaining" counter does math weirdly.
4.  The form doesn't actually submit.

**Your Mission:** Debug the application, fix the logic, and make the page functional.
